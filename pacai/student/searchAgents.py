    Your heuristic for the FoodSearchProblem goes here.

    This heuristic must be consistent to ensure correctness.
    First, try to come up with an admissible heuristic;
    almost all admissible heuristics will be consistent as well.

    If using A* ever finds a solution that is worse than what uniform cost search finds,
    your heuristic is *not* consistent, and probably not admissible!
    On the other hand, inadmissible or inconsistent heuristics may find optimal solutions,
    so be careful.

    The state is a tuple (pacmanPosition, foodGrid) where foodGrid is a
    `pacai.core.grid.Grid` of either True or False.
    You can call `foodGrid.asList()` to get a list of food coordinates instead.

    If you want access to info like walls, capsules, etc., you can query the problem.
    For example, `problem.walls` gives you a Grid of where the walls are.

    If you want to *store* information to be reused in other calls to the heuristic,
    there is a dictionary called problem.heuristicInfo that you can use.
    For example, if you only want to count the walls once and store that value, try:
    ```
    problem.heuristicInfo['wallCount'] = problem.walls.count()
    ```
    Subsequent calls to this heuristic can access problem.heuristicInfo['wallCount'].
